# PSD Analysis using Machine Learning to identify hydraulic conductivity

This repository accompanies the manuscript "Predicting Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity from Particle Size Distributions using Machine Learning" (submitted/under revision). 

The repository provides routines to perform particle size distribution (PSD) analysis, particularly workflows to estimate hydraulic conductivity with six Machine Learning (ML) algorithms:
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- XGBoost (XG)
- Linear Regression (LR)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

The package also includes methods for identification of properties, like grain diameter percentiles (d10, d50, d60 etc) and for calculation of hydraulic conductivity through empirical formulas. 

The algorithms are tested on soil sample data from the "TopIntegraal" project provided by TNO. (data not yet avaialbe due to license issues, planned to be provided soon)
